CS 455 Extra Credit Assignment —— Some List Functions
=====================================================
Introduction and Background
---------------------------
The assignment is to implement some functions that operate on C++ linked lists. It's a little more like a lab, in that you just write those specific functions: we wrote all the test code for you. (However, I would expect it to take more time than a lab session to complete.) Unlike a lab you are required to do the work independently (i.e., no partnerships).

Like PA5, this is a multi-file program with a Makefile that uses separate compilation. We did that primarily to give us the freedom to easily test your code using a different test driver than the one we gave you. Hopefully between the Makefile handout (readings for Week 15), the recent lectures, and the last assignment, you are feeling comfortable with multi-file C++ programs.
