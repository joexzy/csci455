"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]


The code in line 85-88 of Bar.java is from 2.10.4 in textbook.
To get a random number in CoinTossSimulator.java, I used the code in 6.9.1 in textbook.

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:



----------------------------------------------
ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1. The code written by the course staff for the purposes of helping students in the course, or the code from the textbook for this
course.

2. Two heads: 25%, Two Tails: 25%, One head and one tailï¼š 50%
Suppose there are a coin A and a coin B. And we definite 1 as the head of a coin, 0 as the tail of a coin. There are 4 results : A1B1, A1B0 , A0B0 and A0B1. These 4 events have the same probability. So one head and one tail could have the probability of 50 percent which is different from the others.

3. 900.

4. 2000000000 
The largest number I have tried is 2100000000 where it worked correctly. And 2200000000 would make it overflowed.
