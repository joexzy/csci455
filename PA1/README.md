CS 455 Programming Assignment 1
===============================
Introduction
-------------
In this assignment you will write a graphics-based program to simulate someone tossing a pair of coins some number of times, and display the results. So for example the user may request 10 trials. For each trial two coins are tossed. The program reports in bar graph form how many times the result was two heads, how many times it was two tails, and how many times it was one of each.
This assignment will give you practice with creating and implementing classes, using loops, using the java library for random number generation, doing console-based IO, and drawing to a graphics window. Also you'll get practice in general program development.
